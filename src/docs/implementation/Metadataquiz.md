*This [Metadata quiz](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/metadataquiz/) is meant to help you find the metadata checklists and endpoint repositories best suited for your data.*

Annotating your experimental data with extensive metadata on the experimental setup and data analysis enables the proper interpretation and reuse of your data. To help identify and standardize the relevant metadata to collect for different types of experiments, several minimum information standards have been developed. These comprise the parameters of plant growth, sample preparation, measurement and data processing that are of relevance for a specific research domain. Similarly, data repositories often define checklists of metadata that are required for uploading specific types of data. It is often beneficial to think about what kind of metadata to collect already at the beginning of an experiment, because it ensures proper documentation and avoids information loss. 
Since it can be difficult to have an overview of the metadata guidelines that fit your experiment, we created a simple metadata quiz to guide you to the repositories and metadata checklists relevant for your data. It will also suggest spreadsheet templates for the metadata annotation tool Swate. It can thus help you in the planning phase of your experiment to consider meaningful metadata and repositories but also during your experiment and analysis while annotating your data or when preparing your data for data submission. 

Please note that the results of this quiz are meant to provide an overview of important metadata and repositories for your field. Depending on the specifics of your experiment there might be more specialized repositories better suited to your data that are not included in this quiz.
